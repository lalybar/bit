People are re-inventing and duplicating code components already written before on daily basis. \nThis wastes precious time and effort which can be better invested in building new things. Components can be improved and evolved without having to start from scratch every time. Duplicating components across repositories isn't any better, as maintaining or changing a single function becomes an odyssey, and the larger the code base the worse it gets. \nUp until Bit, the only way to make components reusable was to spend too much time on boilerplating and build configuration just to end up having to maintain a git repo, a package and CI for every small component. This isn’t practical and is very hard to scale.\nTo understand the solution we turned back to the basics of writing code, as we were taught from day one. We should create independent and isolated components. We should also manage them to make this a practical practice.\nTo achieve this we designed Bit - the first code component manager. Bit is a distributed manager written in javascript yet designed to be language agnostic. It allows you to make components reusable with zero initial configuration and use these components across repositories. It also helps to store, organize and manage your components. It allows you to group your components by context, while also handling versioning, dependency management, build and test execution and more. Bit also makes components easy to find and collaborate on.\nAt the end of the day, distributed component management is deeply connected to the very basics of writing software as we want it to be. Managing code components can help us all to build great things out of smaller building blocks - together. Imagine the possibilities.\n"},"installation.html":{"url":"installation.html","title":"Installing Bit","keywords":"","body":"Using NPM\nIf you have NPM installed, you can use it to install Bit: (recommended)\nnpm install bit-bin --global\nUsing brew (macOS)\nHomebrew - Bit can be installed via Homebrew package manager:\nbrew install bit (currently unavailable)\nDebian/Ubuntu Linux\nOn Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can install Bit via our Debian package repository.

Create a Bit component:\nbit create is-string\nThis creates an implementation file in the inline_components directory.\n2. Write the component's implementation in the impl.js file created for the component.\n`open ./inline_components/global/is-string/impl.js`\nYou can copy and paste this example:\n  module.exports = function isString(val) {\n    return typeof val === 'string';\n  };\n\n\nYou can see the status of all the components in your project using: bit status.\n\nUse it in your code\n3. Install the bit-js module using NPM or Yarn.\nnpm install bit-js\n4.

Now simply run the application node index.js.\nbit-js will resolve the component from the inline_components directory.\n\nRead more about Drivers.\n\nCommit your code\nOur goal is to use a component in our future work. Before exporting it to a remote scope, it needs to committed from your inline_components to your local scope.\n6. bit commit is-string 'initial commit'\n\nYour component moved from the inline_components directory into the components directory. and you can still use it with bit-js same way as before.\n\nYou can view the component you just added to your scope: bit show @this/is-string\n\n@this stands for local scope notation, you can also call the scope in it's real name located in .bit/scope.json file.\n\nUse bit status to get a clear view of all components in your local scope.\n\n@this, is the local scope annotation. That means when you want to refer to your local scope, you can use @this instead the real scope name (located in the scope.json file under the .bit directory)\n\n\nExport to a remote scope\nRemote scopes allow you to use the components they contain in any repository or project. They also allow you to collaborate with others while using and managing your components together.\nImportant ! -  If you don't have a remote scope yet, please create one on Setup a remote scope\n\nExport the component to the remote scope using bit export @this/is-string @scopy\n\nassuming that you created @scopy in the initial setup chapter\n\nYour component exported from the local scope, but it is still in the components directory, and available for requiring in the project. it also adds it to the bit.json file as a dependency.\n\nyou can use bit list @scopy and bit show @scopy/is-string to verify that your component exported correctly.\n\n\nImport a component\nTL.DR\n\nmkdir  && cd \nbit init\nbit import / --save\nOpen a new directory somewhere else.\nmkdir different-project && cd different-project\nCreate a new scope\nbit init\nimport the component and save it in bit.json file.\nbit import @scopy/is-string --save\nYou can see that the component was exported to the project. (located in the components directory)\nModify a component\nTL.DR\n\nbit modify \nbit commit \nbit export @this \nFirst, a few notes about versioning - Bit doesn’t use semantic versioning. Instead, it supports only incremented component versioning. For example, the first version of a component will be 1, the second will be 2 and so forth.\nLet's say we want to add documentation to the component we just created.\n1. Import the component to the inline_bits folder:\nbit modify is-string\nThe component is also in the staging area as you can see by typing bit status.\nWhen you'll commit it, the version will increment itself.\n2. Make some changes. you can also copy and paste the following code.\n\n  \n  /**\n  * determines whether `val` is a string.\n  * @param {*} val reference to test.\n  * @returns {boolean}\n  * @example\n  * ```js\n  *  isString('') // => true\n  *  isString(1) // => false\n  * ```\n  */\n  module.exports = function isString(val) {\n    return typeof val === 'string';\n  };\n  \n\n\n3. Commit the changes you have made to the component to your staging area.\nbit commit is-string \"added documentation\"\n4. Now the component is ready to be updated in the remote scope. export it.\nbit export @this/is-string @scopy\nYour changes will be published to the remote scope as a new version for the same component.\nVerify the version change with show command.\nbit show @scopy/is-string\n\nyou can read more about js-doc parsing Here\n\nUse a compiler\n1. Import the Flow environment to your local scope, and set it as default to all newly created components:\n  bit import bit.envs/compilers/babel --compiler --save\n// TODO\nTest a component\nTL.DR\n\nbit import  --tester --save\nbit modify /\nbit add-spec \nopen inline_components//spec.js // add tests\nbit test --component \nbit commit  \"\"\nbit export @this/ \n1. Import the Mocha environment to your local scope, and set it as default to all newly created components:\nbit import bit.envs/testers/mocha --tester --save\nA tester enables you to test your components, read more about it Here\n2. Modify bit modify @scopy/is-string.\n3. Add a spec.js file using bit add-spec is-string or you can just create spec.js file yourself yourself.\n4. Open the spec.js file: open inline_components/global/is-string/spec.js\n5. Paste this implementation or write tests of your own:\nconst expect = require('chai').expect;\nconst isString = require(__impl__);\n\ndescribe('#isString()', () => {\n  it('should return true if `foo` is passed', () => {\n    expect(isString('foo')).to.equal(true);\n  });\n\n  it('should return false if `1` is passed', () => {\n    expect(isString(1)).to.equal(false);\n\n  it('should return false if `[]` is passed', () => {\n    expect(isString([1]])).to.equal(false);\n  });\n\n\nnote that the __impl__ is a reference to the impl file injected by the testing environment.\nyou can't use node modules like you would normal do, because the component should be exported to an isolated environment and run the specs there. you can only require the modules that the tester provides,\n\n6. Run the component's specs bit test --inline is-string.\n7. Commit the component bit commit is-string \"add unit tests\".\n8.

A Scope is a dynamic codebase responsible to end-to-end management of code components.\nScopes are where components are stored, tested, built and integrate with each other.\nThe Scope's distributed nature is meant to enable teams to create scopes for every different level of abstraction inside the organization.\nFor example, a team in an organization may want\nEach component belongs in a scope (or multiple scopes). therefore, the scope's name appears in the component's ID path (which consists of owner/scope/box/component).\nComponent Store\nBit stores all components with version in a content-addressable filesystem.\nThis enables Bit to...\n// TODO\nDependency Resolution and Management\nBit's dependency resolution and management was especially designed for the use code components.\nTherefore, we designed its dependency management mechanism with few relevent and major constraints in mind:\n\nInstallation (import) performance - To make \nPredictable and deterministic - The same dependencies will be installed at the same exact version, anywhere and acoross every machine to avoid dependency hell and deep dependency debugging.\nComponent availability - components should be made always available \n\nWhen you build a new component, you can add as many dependencies as you need in the bit.json file.\nThe bit export command will ensure the component will be packaged with all its dependencies.\nWhen bit push is issued, the new component, with all its dependencies, will all be uploaded to the scope.\nOnce a component is pushed to a scope, the receiving scope will try to build and test the component to ensure it is, in fact, isolated.\nbit import will download the component with all of its dependencies in a single call.\nThe benefits of on-export dependency resolution.\n\nFast build time - When your application builds Bit does nothing but simply downloading a flat list of dependencies. That's it. Bit doesn’t have a dependency tree, so no need for recalculating and downloading more dependencies. This means a faster build time. \nReliability - Since every component is stored with its dependencies, in a tested version to work with, you can be sure it will keep working in any new environment regardless of any changes made to its dependencies (even if deleted).\nNo duplications - Bit knows what are the exact dependencies it needs to grab, so if there are any duplications, it will simply download a single working copy. \n\nScope CI\nBit comes with a built-in slim CI mechanism.\n// TODO\nDiscoverability\nOne of the major issues with today’s package managers is that finding the right package is hard. Even if you've found the right package, you still need to figure out how to use it.\nThe journey from searching a certain package with an implemented functionality to finding and using it is long and full of uncertainty. This is exactly why developers end-up rewriting stuff and duplicating it.\nBit solves both these issues by design.\n\nFinding the right component -\n Bit has an internal search engine capable of searching in all the scopes connected to your computer. This search engine can be accessed from your CLI so that you do not need to leave your development environment while still having access to external resources.\n The search engine works by indexing and querying over the documentation you write in the components themselves (there are no README.md files at all). That code itself is the most up-to-date place to point out the component’s functionality. Keeping the code and comments updated will make sure you can find the components you need.\n\nLearning to use components -\n Normally, while writing and maintaining packages, you need to have a README.md file of sort that other developers can read and learn how to use your package.\n Maintaining it means more manual work, ending up in these files often not being up-to-date. They may even contain false information, and cause frustration when trying to use a new package.\n Keeping the component documentation right with the code itself means that it'll always be updated, approachable, and easy to use.\n\nCombining search and documentation -\n By integrating the search engine to the code's documentation we can assure that you will find the most accurate result, which is sure to be maintained and working, with the latest version of the component.\n\n\n"},"bit-component.html":{"url":"bit-component.html","title":"Bit Component","keywords":"","body":"Component ID\nBit components are universally and uniquely identified using a Bit ID to support the distributed nature of a Scope.\nEach Bit component has its own ID which is a composition of the scope name, namespace and name of the component.\nFor example, a component named string/is stored in a Scope named foo would have the following ID:\n@foo/string/is\nIn case the component's source is stored on your local scope, you can also use the @this keyword syntactic-sugar to reference it.\n@this/string/is\nTo reference a component which was not committed to any scope yet and exists within the inline_components directory,\njust ignore the scope name.\nstring/is\nIn this case, Bit will look for a directory named string with a component directory named is in your inline_components directory.\nComponent Versioning\nBit only supports incremental versioning. One might wonder if this is a lesser way of doing things. If using SemVer is better, because you get small fixes automatically. But, as we see in new packaging tools (OSTree, Snappy), the later approach is being increasingly unused. SemVer is based on a developer decision, and as such, is not bullet-proof.\nBit handles small code component with a single responsibility, not large packages. Such components simply tend to change less often. This made us favor strict versioning over SemVer and automatic updates.

This command packages your component and runs the Bit CI cycle to test and build the component. The final result is extracted from your inline folder to the project’s local scope.\nImportant notes:\n\nIt is considered best practice try and keep the inline_components empty. You should only have components in there if you are currently working on them.\n\nThis folder should be a part of your project, so it can't be in the .gitignore file (for example).\n\nThe drivers that implement the resolution algorithm will check the inline_components before going to the components directory.\n\n\ncomponents directory\nThe components directory is managed by Bit.

They can help organize your components.\nif you don't specify a box, the component will be created at the global box.\nExample: bit create array\\sort # create the component 'sort' in the 'array' box.\nExample: bit create do-work # create the component 'do-work' in the 'global' box.\nTo use components within boxes, you can append the box name to the component's ID when calling it.\nExample: bit('array\\sort');\nExample: bit('do-work');\ninline_components\nThe inline_components directory is a workspace for creating new components.\nCreating or modifying a component can be done directly from your inline_components directory, without having to create a new project or switching contexts. This is a key concept in Bit's workflow.\nyou can create a component yourself, or use bit create \nOnce you are done writing (or modifying) a component, you can commit the changes using the bit commit  command. This command packages your component and runs the Bit CI cycle to test and build the component. The final result is extracted from your inline folder to the project’s local scope.\nImportant notes:\n\nIt is considered best practice try and keep the inline_components empty. You should only have components in there if you are currently working on them.\n\nThis folder should be a part of your project, so it can't be in the .gitignore file (for example).\n\nThe drivers that implement the resolution algorithm will check the inline_components before going to the components directory.\n\n\ncomponents directory\nThe components directory is managed by Bit. All the imported components will be there.\nbit.json\nThe bit.json file is used as a configuration file for project and component levels.\nproject bit.json\nUsed for defining project dependencies (bit components), that will be imported in the bit import command.\nAlso, used as a prototype for defining default properties for the components in the inline_directory.\n\nfor example, if a component does not have a bit.json file, it inherits all properties (besides dependencies) from the project's bit.json.\n\ncomponent bit.json\nUsed for defining the component's dependencies, package dependencies, compiler, tester, and the names of impl. and spec. files.\nEnvironment\nBit consists of two main environments build (compile) and test.\nBuild environment\nSome programming languages need some sort of compiling/transpiling in order for them to run. If you use such language, Bit will make sure that the code you write will be able to compile anywhere.\nCompiler\nThe required compiler your code needs is defined in bit.json { env: { compiler: compiler_id }}.\nThe build environment is just a Bit component with a simple interface. It must have a compile method, which is a sync method that accepts raw source code (string) and returns compiled code (string).\nTest environment\nThere are many designated libraries to run unit tests for code. Each developer chooses the one her/she needs.\nTester\nthe tester, like the compiler, it's just a Bit component implementing the tester interface. It is defined in bit.json under { env: { tester: tester_id }}.\n// TODO - write about the tester interface\n"}}}
